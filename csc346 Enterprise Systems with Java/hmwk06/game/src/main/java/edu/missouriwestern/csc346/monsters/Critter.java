/**
 * Critter is the super class for monsters.
 * Generally getters are public.
 * Setters are mostly protected because only things in this package should use them.
 * Some are private and/or final if they are vital to game balance
 *
 * Do not print from a critter.  Only store messages in the strings.  Do not assume
 * that System.out will be available.
 *
 * Fields:
 *
 * critterName:String  -- Should be no more than 10 characters
 * imageCharacter:String  -- This should be a single Unicode character, although most of the
 *                   codes will deconstruct into two characters.
 *                   See https://www.alt-codes.net/animal-symbols.php  ðŸ¦–
 *
 * weight:double  -- Weight in kg.  An adult human would be 100.0.
 *                   Weight was supposed to factor into survivability, but it is not
 *                   really used in the current version
 * stamina:double -- 1.0 for a healthy adult human.  Not really used in current except to set starting health.
 * health:double  -- 1.0 is 100% health.  It cannot be over 100% at the start of the game
 *                   and it should not increase unless the game incorporates recovery
 *                   Anything less than 0.0 is dead
 *                   Essentially, health is the percentage of life.
 * aggressiveness:double -- probability the critter will attack in a given round
 *                          Must be 0.0 to 1.0.  1.00 would be 100% chance of attack
 *
 *                 ATTACKS:
 *
 *                 Attack stats should be set in the attack method.  A critter's attack should
 *                 call setAttackMessage(String) and setAttackEffectiveness(double).
 *
 * attackMessage:String -- This message must be set by the concrete critter on each round.
 *                         A complex character might attack with different weapons, or
 *                         they might use the same weapon differently.
 * attackEffectiveness:double How effective was an attack this round?  0.0 is an ineffective hit.
 *                            Should be set in attack by calling setAttackEffectiveness(double)
 *                            1.0 is a kill shot and should be very rare.
 *                            A normal attack with fists would be about 0.02.
 *                            A sword strike by an ordinary human would be about 0.25.
 *                            A full attack by an adult tRex might be a 1.0 attack or greater.
 *                            The effectiveness will be reduced by a random factor in game play.
 *
 *                    DEFENSE
 *
 *                    Critters do not have to have a defense.  Generally only complex critters will have them.
 *                    If a critters has a defense it should implement the DEFENSE interface.
 *                    Critters are initialized with an empty string for their attack message.
 *                    (to be honest, defense is not working exactly as intended, and the having
 *                    a non-empty defense string is what triggers calling defend() )
 *
 *                    Defend works pretty much like attack.  There is a message and an effectiveness.
 *                    Defensive techniques should be very weak for game balance.
